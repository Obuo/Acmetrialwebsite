                <p>Here Jesus was talking to the people you and me. As humans, we have things in this life that we need and cannot live without for example food, water, clothings and others. In versus 25 to 31, Jesus is telling us not to worry, God knows what we need. He has called us His children, so as our father, He knows what we want and will surely provide. If He can do it for the birds, how about us who are much greater than them</p>
